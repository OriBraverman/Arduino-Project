# Arduino-Project
The project is a new way to play the nostalgic game Icy Tower with the help of Arduino.
With the help of Arduino we built two units: one is connected in the form of a hat that 
the player wears (like the Icy Tower logo) and the other is connected to the computer.
The first unit monitors the player's actions such as jumping and tilting the head left 
and right and the second unit sends these actions with the help of the keys to the game.
